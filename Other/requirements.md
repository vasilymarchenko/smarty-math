### Specification for the Web-Based Logic Puzzle Game

#### **Game Description**

The application is a **logic puzzle game** where players solve puzzles by making logical connections between different categories (e.g., names, houses, years, paintings). Each level presents a unique story and clues, requiring players to deduce relationships (e.g., "Mr. Orange lives in the orange house"). The gameplay revolves around marking correct (`O`) and incorrect (`X`) associations in a grid to find the one correct solution for each puzzle.

The puzzles are designed to challenge players’ deductive reasoning and logical thinking. The stories and clues for each level are crafted to immerse players in different scenarios, such as matching characters to professions, identifying relationships between events, or solving mysteries based on given hints. For example, a puzzle might involve determining which artist painted which picture based on subtle and interlinked clues.

Each puzzle grid consists of a predefined set of rows and columns representing categories and possible options. Players must use logical reasoning to eliminate incorrect matches and confirm correct ones. The complexity of puzzles increases with progression, introducing more categories and intricate relationships between options.

The game caters to both casual players and logic enthusiasts, offering a hint system for beginners and rewarding experienced players with achievements for solving puzzles quickly and accurately. Players can track their progress, earn points, and unlock new levels with unique themes and challenges.

The goal of the game is to solve the puzzles by logical reasoning rather than guesswork. Players can progress through levels of increasing difficulty, earn points or rewards, and receive feedback on their solutions.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

#### **MVP Description**

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the game will focus on delivering the core functionality to allow users to experience the logic puzzle gameplay. The MVP will include the following:

1. **Single Level:**
   - Include a single pre-designed puzzle to introduce players to the gameplay mechanics.
   - The puzzle will feature a grid with 2-3 categories and a manageable number of options (e.g., 3-5 per category).

2. **Standard Mode:**
   - Only support the standard mode where players solve puzzles sequentially.
   - Exclude challenge mode and custom puzzle features for the MVP.

3. **Localization:**
   - Launch with a single language (e.g., English) for all stories, clues, and the UI.
   - Prepare the system for future localization by structuring text resources (e.g., using JSON or a similar format) to easily add support for additional languages later.

4. **Gameplay Mechanics:**
   - Fully functional interactive grid for marking `X` and `O`.
   - Basic feedback for solving the puzzle (e.g., a success message upon completion).
   - Static clues displayed alongside the puzzle.

5. **Frontend:**
   - Responsive design to support desktop and mobile devices.

6. **Backend:**
   - API support to fetch the puzzle data and validate solutions.
   - Basic storage of user progress (e.g., whether the puzzle was completed).

7. **Deployment:**
   - Host the frontend on Azure Static Web Apps.
   - Deploy the backend using Azure Container Apps with Cosmos DB for storing puzzle data and user progress.

8. **Scalability:**
   - The system should be designed to allow easy addition of more levels, languages, and features in subsequent iterations.

### Functional Requirements

#### **Gameplay Mechanics**
1. **Interactive Grid System:**
   - A matrix interface where players can mark cells with `X` or `O`.
   - Categories displayed as rows and columns (e.g., Names, Houses, Colors).
   - Dynamic validation feedback (e.g., visual indication for correct or incorrect marks).

2. **Stories and Clues:**
   - Each level starts with a short story or context to set the puzzle.
   - Clues are displayed and updated dynamically as the puzzle progresses.
   - Optional hint system for players who are stuck.

3. **Puzzle Solving:**
   - Only one valid solution per puzzle.
   - Automatic validation of completed puzzles.
   - Scoring system based on completion time, accuracy, and hint usage.

4. **Level Progression:**
   - Unlock levels progressively with increasing difficulty.
   - Save progress so users can resume from their last solved puzzle.

5. **Feedback and Rewards:**
   - Display success feedback (e.g., congratulatory message).
   - Gamification elements, such as points or coins for solving puzzles.

6. **Localization:**
   - Support multiple languages for stories, clues, and UI.

#### **Game Modes**
1. **Standard Mode:**
   - Sequential puzzles with predefined difficulty levels.
   
2. **Challenge Mode (Optional):**
   - Time-limited or score-based puzzles.
   
3. **Custom Mode (Optional):**
